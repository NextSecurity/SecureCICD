> Modern pipelines make approvals fast — but they also make abuse easier.  
> Here's how to eliminate one of the **most common enterprise misconfigurations** with SecureCICD.

## 🚨 Real-World Problem

### ❌ Self-Approvals
Developers approve their **own commits** — bypassing 4-eyes policies.

### ❌ Reassignment Trick
Approval step reassigned to a **shadow user**, fake bot, or another dev.

### ❌ SoD Breakdown
DevOps UI allows anyone with access to "click approve" — no runtime gate.

---

## ✅ SecureCICD Mitigates These in 3 Ways:

### 1. Runtime Validator

Each pipeline sends a `POST` to SecureCICD:

```json
{
  "approver": "jane@company.com",
  "author": "john@company.com",
  "reassigned": false,
  "pipeline_id": "prod-release",
  "commit_id": "abcdef"
}
```

It responds:
- `200 OK` = trusted, valid approval
- `403 Forbidden` = blocked: self-approval, reassignment, or rogue user

---

### 2. Allowlist by Group

Set approver groups via ENV or config:

```env
ALLOWED_APPROVERS=svc-release,secops,ENG\DevLeads,SEC\Architects
```

---

### 3. Full Audit Trail

Every decision is logged:
- Who approved?
- Was it blocked or allowed?
- From which pipeline?

Output format: **structured JSON** → easy to forward to SIEM.
